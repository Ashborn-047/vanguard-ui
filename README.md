Vanguard UI is a professional, multi-aesthetic React component library designed for interfaces that need to shift between design realities. It features a unique **Runtime Aesthetic Engine** that allows users to swap entire design systems—from Neo-Brutalism to Glassmorphism—instantly.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Multi-Aesthetic Engine**: Shift between 6+ design realities at runtime.
- **Reality Presets**:
    - **Neo-Brutalism**: High contrast, bold borders, raw aesthetic.
    - **Glassmorphism**: Translucency, blur effects, multi-layered depth.
    - **Liquid Glass**: High backdrop-blur, semi-transparent white layers.
    - **Skeuomorphism**: Tactile, real-world object mimicry.
    - **Claymorphism**: Fluffy 3D shapes, soft shadows.
    - **Minimalism**: Clean lines, ample whitespace, flat colors.
- **Production-Ready**: A vast array of components including Navigation Menus, Tables, Drawers, OTP Inputs, and more.
- **Tactile Lab**: Specialized skeuomorphic controls like Faders and Tactile Toggles.
